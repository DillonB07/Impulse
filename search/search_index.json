To give you a quick rundown, an API is an Application Programming Interface. It is a software interface that offers a service to other pieces of software. If you didn't understand that, then just think of it as a connection to a website/server that gives the program certain information. What APIs does Impulse use? Impulse uses three APIs: Google Speech Recognition API - As you might guess, this is used to turn your speech into text for the program to understand. Google Calendar API - Uses Google OAuth2/Authentication library to link to your Google account and get events from your Google Calendar Jokes API - Used for getting random jokes for the joke command.","title":"APIs"},{"location":"APIs/#api-usages","text":"","title":"API Usages"},{"location":"APIs/#what-is-an-api","text":"To give you a quick rundown, an API is an Application Programming Interface.

Presets allow you to keep certain pieces of information inside the program so that you don't need to manually enter it each time you run the program Setting Presets The current presets are: Username Go to the main.py file and underneath the imports, you will see a variable called USER . This variable is for use when launching applications. It must be the same as your username on your mac. Not sure what your username is? Go to /Users/ and see what your folder is called. That is your username. Comment out the input line and on the line above, set it to this: USER = 'USERNAME' Nick Go to the main.py file and underneath the imports, you will see a variable called NICK .

Family Jokes Google Exit WARNINGS: You must authenticate with the window that opens, or the code will not run (I didn\u2019t think I should verify it, so it will say that it might not be safe) Impulse is slow due to the modules used. This cannot be helped sadly. Impulse requires an Internet connection to work as the Speech to Text uses a Google Service. The jokes also use an API that will not work without Internet Connection Impulse may not understand you all of the time, as the Google Speech to Text is not amazing TIPS: Watch the console.

When a \u201c.\u201d is printed to the screen, Impulse has finished listening and will execute your command. When you see \u201cEnd\u201d, you can start again by saying \u201cImpulse\u201d Your speech will be on the console, so you can see if he heard correctly. - It will take a while to show up. Be patient. It takes a while to work depending on the speed of the connection to Google servers, the Joke API(for joke command) and the clearness of your voice.
