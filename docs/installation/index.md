## Installing


Here are the links to the each version of Impulse. You can download Impulse from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dbarnes18/Impulse) or from [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/p759r04skqulo/Impulse):


### MediaFire
* [v1.0.0](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qzio6xhrz9k0rxb/Impulse-v1.0.0.zip/file)

### GitHub Releases

* [v1.0.0](https://github.com/dbarnes18/Impulse/releases/tag/v1.0.0)


## Setting Up


Here is what you need to do to setup Impulse:


1. After downloading the `.zip` file, unzip it


2. Now, open your Terminal (*found inside `Applications/Utilities`*), `cd` to the folder where Impulse is


3. Activate the virtual environment. On macOS there is an issue with the modules, and it is extremely tricky to fix, but if you use the virtual environment, it is ready for you.


4. Run `main.py`


### Example


```bash
cd Downloads/Impulse-v1.0.0
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```


Now, you have setup Impulse! Say `Impulse` to start using him!
