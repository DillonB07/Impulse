## What is an API?

To give you a quick rundown, an API is an Application Programming Interface. It is a software interface that offers a service to other pieces of software.

If you didn't understand that, then just think of it as a connection to a website/server that gives the program certain information.

## What APIs does Impulse use?

Impulse uses three APIs:

1. [Google Speech Recognition API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/speech.googleapis.com) - As you might guess, this is used to turn your speech into text for the program to understand.


2. [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com) - Uses Google OAuth2/Authentication library to link to your Google account and get events from your Google Calendar


3. [Jokes API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) - Used for getting random jokes for the joke command.
